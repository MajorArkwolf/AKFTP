\section{PreInformation}
Extension from the Unit Coordinator was given and is attached below. \\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{extension}

The group also asked permission to use CMake to generate the Make file. Hong Advised as long as it can make a make file and build using make this was acceptable. The guide on how to use Cmake is in the Building section.\\

\section{Information}
Design and implement a simple network protocol that can be used to download files from a remote site and to upload files to a remote site, and a client and a server programs that communicate using that protocol. The protocol is using TCP as its transport layer protocol. The server can have multiple clients request simultaneously. For simplicity we did not consider any authentication process in this project, hence the server will provide its service to any client with the right site address and port number.

\section{Self Diagnosis and Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The way we have implemented our code makes it portable while also being cross platform on both macOS to Linux. This does make it more complicated and with out extensive checking possibly more error prone.
\item Using a shared library between our client and our server gives us the ability to keep shared code consistent between both the server and client. This avoids any issues of changes to one causing unpredictable behaviour in the other.
\item Using a third party library for serialisation and deserialisation means that our backbone is robust and simpler to parse. This removes any headaches that come with parsing strings in C.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution Breakdown}
The solution devised is that there is a client and a server program. However, a large chunk of code is required in both. We needed to ensure that the client and the server followed the protocols and any under the hood changes to one side didn't break the other. This was solved by having our own shared library that both programs pull down from. By doing this way, refactoring chunks of code can be achieved with out breaking the functions calling them.\\

The underlying data structure for communication from client and server is JSON. This allows us to use key data pairs. If a key exists the data corresponding to the key must exist. This ensures that parsing data is simple, safe and effective. The reason this is safer is because we are able to stop a function if a key is missing and instead report and error.\\

A short fall in using JSON is that any string must only be null terminated once. This means that binary data is dangerous being stored in a json string. To ensure avoiding this limitation, we encode our data into base64. While this can give us a 40\% overhead on file size at the absolute worst, this ensures that the JSON payload wont break during transmission. We believe that the trade off is worth the reliability that JSON offers.

\section{Protocol}
\subsection{Commands and JSON}
As mentioned prior, JSON is the backbone of the FTP client and server as it allows for serialisation and deserialisation of the data between the two. Another benefit of implementing JSON is that if an error occurs in this process we can also assume that the data sent was not completed.
\subsubsection{CD}
Changes the current directory on the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{command:} The command to be processed on the server.
\item \textbf{dir:} The directory to be changed into relative to the current directory. 
\item \textbf{error:} The error number reported by the operation of the function. 0 represents no error.   
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{DIR}
Lists all the the directories and file relative the current working directory on the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{command:} The command to be processed on the server.
\item \textbf{error:} The error number reported by the operation of the function. 0 represents no error.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{PWD}
Gives the absolute path to the current working directory of the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{command:} The command to be processed on the server.
\item \textbf{error:} The error number reported by the operation of the function. 0 represents no error.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{PUT}
Takes a file from the client and places it on the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{command:} The command to be processed on the server.
\item \textbf{filename:} The file name to write the data too.
\item \textbf{filedata:} Data of the file that was sent, this is encoded in base64 to ensure that null terminators do not break the json string.
\item \textbf{ensize:} The encoded length of the string.
\item \textbf{desize:} The decoded length of the string.
\item \textbf{error:} The error number reported by the operation of the function. 0 represents no error.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{GET}
Takes a file from the server and places it on the client.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{command:} The command to be processed on the server.
\item \textbf{filename:} The file name to write the data too.
\item \textbf{filedata:} Data of the file that was sent, this is encoded in base64 to ensure that null terminators do not break the json string.
\item \textbf{ensize:} The encoded length of the string.
\item \textbf{desize:} The decoded length of the string.
\item \textbf{error:} The error number reported by the operation of the function. 0 represents no error.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Send and Receive}
The functions listed above all use the existing TCP protocol implemented by the POSIX standards.
\subsubsection{Send Protocol}
The send protocol that is implemented follows these rules.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Attempt to send the size of the data the recipient needs to receive.
    \item Await a response to confirm the recipient is ready. If no value or a false value is received, terminate send.
    \item Recipient sends confirmation that it is ready.
    \item Send payload, deduct how many bytes were sent from the total until the total is equal to zero.
    \item Return 0 if success otherwise return -1.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Receive Protocol}
The receive protocol that is implemented follows these rules.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wait for sender to confirm the size of the data.
    \item If size is received acknowledge by sending true, else send false and terminate receive process.
    \item Await sender to begin transfer of data.
    \item Keep looping until the current size is equal to agreed upon size.
    \item If receive error, terminate; else update buffer parameter and return the size to the buffer.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Building}
\subsection{Dependencies}
\subsubsection*{Linux}
The following dependencies are required for Linux.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cmake 3.14
    \item gcc or clang compiler
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{macOS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cmake 3.14
    \item gcc or clang compiler
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Building}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Please ensure you have the dependencies before you continue.}
\end{center}
To generate the build scripts please run from the root directory....
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release    
\end{lstlisting}
Change into the build directory
\begin{lstlisting}
cd build/    
\end{lstlisting}
Now call make to begin the compilation process like so.
\begin{lstlisting}
make myftp myftpd    
\end{lstlisting}
The compiler should have produced 2 unix executables, myftp is the client program and myftpd is the server program.
\section{Executing}
\subsection{Server}
To run the server just execute myftpd, no additional information is required.
\begin{lstlisting}
    ./myftpd
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Client}
Running the client, an IP address will need to be parsed in should you wish to connect to a server that is not local. Failing to provide an IP address on the first argument will result in the IP being bound to 127.0.0.1. 

Example of setting an ip...
\begin{lstlisting}
    ./myftp 1.1.1.1
\end{lstlisting}
or
\begin{lstlisting}
    ./myftp arkwolf.com
\end{lstlisting}
